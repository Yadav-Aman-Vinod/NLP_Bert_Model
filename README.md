# NLP_Bert_Model

When we train models on large data, we can also use them where data is less. The idea is that instead of training models from the start, we can boost classification accuracy using BERT models that are already trained. 
I used the IMDb dataset full of movie reviews tagged on sentiment available on Kaggle. We apply the dataset to a model built on BERT, checking its effectiveness using accuracy as a parameter for measurement.
